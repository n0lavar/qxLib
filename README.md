A few useful things I developed while studying:
+ RAII for OpenGL stuff
+ non-standart containers (like triangular vector or vector2d) or more practical containers (like string with "from", "to", "format" etc methods)
+ some algorithms implementations
+ other things like logger(with enabling/disabling logging from particular file or function), smart enum(with "to_string", "from_string" methods), assertions etc

Dependencies:
+ C++17
+ glm for gl module and some algorithms
+ glew if you want to use gl module
